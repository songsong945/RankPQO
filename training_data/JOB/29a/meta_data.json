                "Although 'Chuck Connors (I)' (qv) was considered to be miscast as an attorney, much of the failure of \"Arrest & Trial\" to live up to its potential was allegedly due to interference in the show's writing by producer 'Frank P. Rosenberg' (qv). Connors is said to have butted heads many times with management over this, as well as its treatment of the show's staff (he once walked off the set until the studio resumed providing free coffee and donuts for the crew). Rosenberg was said to have a stack of \"Arrest & Trial\" scripts written by some of the top writers in Hollywood that were ignored in favor of scripts that were increasingly mediocre. \"Arrest & Trial\" was also in one of the worst possible time slots, competing against _\"Bonanza\" (1959)_ (qv), _\"Toast of the Town\" (1948)_ (qv) and _\"The Judy Garland Show\" (1963)_ (qv). When \"Arrest & Trial\" folded after one season, Connors and Universal/Revue severed their contract by \"mutual agreement.\" A year later, Connors was back on TV in another western, _\"Branded\" (1965)_ (qv) that, oddly enough, ran in the same unenviable time slot as \"Arrest & Trial\" but managed to last two seasons. Gazzara returned to enjoy a three-year in the TV series _\"Run for Your Life\" (1965)_ (qv), before appearing in three critically acclaimed films directed by his friend, independent film pioneer 'John Cassavetes (I)' (qv).",

Rocked by the gruesome death of one of their best friends, a group of teenage heroin addicts barricade themselves in an abandoned farmhouse in order to kick the habit. Things get out of hand when the drugs they brought with them for one last 'hoorah'; is more than they bargained for. They struggle to escape with their lives when one of them snaps and turns into a blood-thirsty killer out to get each of them, one by one. Caught in the middle of a menacing social experiment, the teens must overcome the murderous forces within the house as well as the threat that is closing in on them from down the road. With no where to run, they must face their greatest fears and fight for their very survival, or be overcome by the very storm they brought upon themselves. Nostrum is a twisted story of courage, temptation and blind ambition. It is a trip that few will survive and none will forget.",

After being released from her latest stint behind bars, Jerri wants to clean up her life and decides the best way to do so is to go home, where she left thirty-two years earlier when she began her depraved life. She arrives home to find that her mother has died, her father has remarried a much younger woman, and her father fell into a stress induced coma in part because she disappeared. She takes that cleaning up her life one step further when Dr. Putney, her father's doctor, tells her that he may emerge from his coma if life were to return to the way it was before she left, but better as she has to make her father proud. So she decides to go back to her old high school, Flatpoint, to get her high school diploma. She quickly decides the best way to be the best student possible is to participate in and win the state science fair. In her quest, she gets caught up in the competing agendas of: Principal Onyx Blackman, who needs a winning science fair team so as not to have to return discretionary school board funding, which he obtained through fraud and which he has since misappropriated; science teacher Chuck Noblet, a married born-again Christian closet homosexual who tries quietly or not so quietly to win back the affections of his lover, Geoffrey Jellineck, the sensitive art teacher; and Roger Beekman, the winning teacher of the past nine science fairs who Blackman brings into Flatpoint as a ringer much to Noblet's chagrin. Jerri also has to keep her focus on the end goal of her father, which may not be easy to do for a socially unaware middle aged libidinous junkie prostitute who wants to be one of the popular kids, and do it with the big man and the innocent virginal girl on campus.",

Long wary of Hollywood's idea of historical accuracy, he has avoided selling off the rights until he can be convinced someone will do justice to his book and history. Producer Timothy Flint, convinces him he's just the man to bring the truth to life. Little does Allan know, Flint, has nothing of the sort in mind and has involved the author directly in the film only at the insistence of the actor he's seeking for the role of Boone, John Steel. As a documentary crew follows Allan during the pre-production of the film, despite constant reassurances from associate producer Allison Crawford, it becomes obvious he has made a very, very bad choice. Timothy's efforts to keep the truth from Allan are made even more complicated by the screenwriter Benjamin Logan, who continuously mixes up Daniel Boone with Davy Crockett; and by the new director, Max, who stresses the importance of not being 'constrained by historical facts.' Allan begins to see the proverbial writing-on-the-wall and starts to see his reputation in the academic world disintegrating before his eyes. Based on a number of real events the writer experienced in over 15 years in the film industry, The Making of Daniel Boone is an insider's look into the making of a big-budget historical film.",

They're expensive, gumming up the works plumming-wise. Now you might be thinking to yourself, \"But, Uncle Andy, what do I do with all that pearl jam if I can't spew it into Mr. Sock?\" Glad you asked... You can have a lovely time tugging the tiger in the shower each morning - that eliminates the need for a goo glove. But, the day is long, masturbation's fun, so unless we want to take 4 or 5 showers every day, we're gonna need some other options. So let's start with the basics. Tissues. Perfectly acceptable backstop for all that Creamy Italian. They can be rough and dry on such soft, sensitive skin and it can stick to your dick head like a fuckin' band-aid - ouch. From there we move on to more lubricated flack-catchers - specificially, bananas. Step one: Peel the banana. Step two: Slip the peel over your Randy Johnson and start pitching. Now for extra credit, warm up the peel in the microwave. Not too hot! Serious yowza. Also, olive oil, moisturizer, honey, spit, butter, hair conditioner, and Vaseline can all be used for lube. In my opinion, the best lube... is lube. So save your allowance and invest in some soon. Alright, moving on - when you tug your Thomas on the toilet - ffft - shoot right into the bowl. In bed - soft t-shirt, perhaps a downy hand towel of your very own that you don't mind tossing after tossing. There's no such thing as polishing the raised scepter of love too much. It reduces stress, it enhances immune function. Also, practice makes perfect. So work on your control now, while you're a solo artist - you'll be playing some long, happy duets in the future.

When one misty night Murphy, the leader of a local gang of bikers vanishes after a run in with some of the Nuryan pupils, the suspicion falls squarely on them, heightening the tension between the villagers and the mysterious Nuryans. Freddie Saint is one of the few who sees it differently, but that is because of his feelings for one of the pupils the beautiful Carla. But Carla is in trouble, and harbors a terrifying secret that could mean death, for her or for others. The mystery of the vicious murder deepens as expectations are constantly usurped, and tensions grow. Who will be the latest victims of the violence sweeping through the quiet community, and who is ultimately responsible? A fast paced, taut, exciting thriller, Nuryan is a contemporary shocker with a core of genuine mystery that will confound even the most seasoned of genre veterans.",

                "The action takes place back in the 9th century - a time of trouble and constant changes. The central dramatic character is that of Constantine the Philosopher -a thinker, a diplomat and a man of letters. He becomes aware of the seeds of destruction in the flourishing Byzantine civilization and senses the future role of Slav Dom. Long before the advance of the Renaissance he becomes convinced about essential equality of people, irrespective of their language and nationality. However, the vine of philosophy is often laced with the poison of politics. Cunning statesmen think of Constantine simply as a weapon in their hands, but they are soon to realize that they have been tragically deceived. The philosopher and humanist towers high above their immediate practical goals. His literary work gets out of the control of politicians. The alphabet intended as a weapon against the young nation proves to be its strength. Together with his brother Methodius, Constantine created the Slav alphabet, which precipitated the development of Slav culture. The film is happy combination of impressive set pieces and artistic taste as it recreates this historical period.",

The new medical examiner, Dr. Kate Wilding, confirms that the victim was disemboweled but that a head injury was the likely cause of death. He was likely killed at his home and his body moved. His wife Eleanor reappears and it seems she's been having an affair with her fencing instructor. A local police sergeant suspects a group of Druids who had a spat with Preston over access to the henge. There's no direct evidence linking them to the death but then one of the Druids is stabbed to death in her house. A third death leads Barnaby to conclude that greed and a valuable treasure are at the root of it all.",

In spite of all these pressures, Tepoztlan has kept its own special identity. Both the town's main tourist destination and its identity stem from the pyramid above the town, sacred to the god/hero El Tepozteco. Though the locals, or \"tepoztecos\", are officially Christian, as one of them says, \"When we are in trouble, we call on El Tepozteco, because he is our warrior spirit. But when it is time to go to heaven, we turn to the Almighty.\" In 1995, a multinational corporation announced a huge development, with a golf course 700 luxury homes, an industrial park, and a shopping center. Rather than face this threat to their identity, the tepoztecos barricaded the town and fought the project to a standstill. At the forefront of this \"Golf Club War\" was El Tepozteco. Many say he personally led the defense of the barricades, even driving away a federal SWAT team. Certainly his spirit, and his legend, served as a rallying cry for his people and helped them successfully defy the combined might of a multinational corporation and the Mexican state. Today, as for thousands of years, El Tepozteco has given his people the strength to take what they like from the invaders while holding fast to their identity as the children of a living god.",

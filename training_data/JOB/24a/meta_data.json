Vittorio makes several mysterious references to the fate of Mario's first wife Alma, who apparently committed suicide ten years previously. Her curiosity aroused, Alice starts doing some research - but gets no answers either from her husband or his family. Several warnings later, when Alice still won't stop digging up the past , she suddenly finds herself the subject of an evil and complex intrigue: she is suspected of murder, and is forced to flee. Her only chance is to uncover the whole truth. Her exciting and adventure-filled flight into the past takes her from Berlin to Hamburg, Ireland and finally Florence, straight into the powerful Mancini family. There, with Vittorio's help, she discovers what Alma was concealing from her: her husband had an incestuous relationship with his mother, and his youngest brother Alessandro was the child resulting from the relationship. The influential family decided to hide this secret at all costs for fear of scandal. Shortly before the Mancinis manage to dispatch Alice to an institution in the same way they did with Alma, Alice begins to collect information that proves her innocence and heralds the fall of the House of Mancini. Alice and Vittorio are free from the shades of the past, and free to begin a new life.",

The dome's scanner is set for long-range communication, and to their surprise they receive a signal, an image of an ancient spacecraft similar to what the Colonies once flew. After showing the signal to Boomer and Commander Adama, they are sent on a long-range Viper patrol to a distant solar system on the transmission's line - and to their horror they discover a Cylon basestar orbiting one of the system's planets in its search for the Colonial Fleet. They escape to the Galactica undetected, and Adama considers avoiding the system, but then decides that he's tired of running and begins preparation to attack the basestar. Apollo recommends infiltrating the basestar to cripple its centralized command chamber before the Galactica attacks, and to their surprise Adama is able to secure information from Baltar, who is allowed to barter knowledge of the Cylons in exchange for freedom, Adama willing to risk that Baltar will also see eventual rescue by the Cylons. The Galactica thus begins its most important mission yet as battle is joined between the ancient battlestar and her Viper fleet against the stronger Cylon raider phalanx of the basestar.",

LaRue is seeking to advance his own power, and he arbitrarily sets a tax on all wagons using the Santa Fe Trail (yes, check a map of the Republic of Texas before statehood), and orders Captain Colt and his Sergeant, Gabby Whittaker (George \"Gabby\" Hayes), to enforce this ruling. Colt, knowing that if he refuses he will be in no position to combat LaRue's outrageous plans, plays along.

When she and her old-time scout, Hank Purdy (Si Jenks), refuse to pay the tax, Colt places her under arrest and brings her before LaRue. But Jane charms LaRue into allowing her a monopoly of the freight lines using the Santa Fe Trail. Secretly, she is bent upon deposing LaRue, who was responisble for the death of her father. Colt misunderstands her motives, while she is equally contemptuous of his being a tool of LaRue. The other wagon train owners revolt and backed by Colt and Hank Purdy, who has deserted Jane because of her apparent bargain with LaRue, they use force to get the freight wagons through. Purdy is wounded and Jane comes to his aid. Through Gabby, Jane and Roy's misunderstanding are corrected, and they work together until LaRue's treachery is exposed and he is brought to justice.",

He still has his material assets which are sufficient in value to pay off his debts, but that would leave him with nothing.

Guru Gulab is married to Vikrant's stepsister Preeti. The don's legal will, which also includes diamonds worth hundred crores kept in a foreign bank, has to be equally divided between these three and to claim the diamonds from the bank all three all three have to be present at the bank and personally sign the papers. In event of death of any of the inheritors' death, a death certificate has to be produced to the bank. The will factor vertically splits the gang in two. Vikrant and Guru Gulab become rivals. Vikrant wrongly implicates Guru Gulab in a very serious crime, which forces him to flee out of the India. Guru Gulab leaves India for America and comes to stay in the neighborhood of Dr. Anmol Acharya. Meanwhile in India, Vikrant announces grand prize money to those who tell him the whereabouts of Guru. Anmol's greedy wife Mona forces him to meet Vikrant in India and inform him about Guru Gulab and collect the prize money. Anmol comes to India with his father-in- law and the moment they step into India they are picked up by Choto Chhatri, who takes them to a local goon, Eaida Anna. Anna strikes a deal with Vikrant that he'll kill Guru and acquire the prize money offered by him. Vikrant gives him the contract. So Anmol returns, not with prize money but with Anna and Chota Chhatri, and others have this wrong notion that Anna is just interested in the petty contract money. His interest lies in the diamonds. So this race to reach the diamonds becomes deadlier and all three powers - Vikrant, Guru and Anna clash. And the rule of this race is to kill the other contestants to win the race!!!",

Embark upon this incredible journey as Riddles in Stone interviews experts on both sides of the heated debate. Watch as Freemason apologists defend some of the most direct and hard-hitting questions concerning the influence of Masonry in America, and its symbolism in Washington, D.C. Alongside them are leading researchers who maintain that occult architecture permeates the city, and conceals a secret agenda. Was D.C. laid out according to the pattern of the stars? Is there really a pentagram in the street layout north of the White House? Does a Masonic square and compass extend from the Capitol building to the Washington monument? And why is the city filled with zodiac symbols, mysterious faces, and various god and goddess images? If America was founded as a Christian nation only, where are the images of Jesus Christ? Or does Washington D.C. symbolize another Christ, the Masonic Christ?",

Every parent prays to God that they be blessed with an intelligent and physically powerful male child and if it is a female child she be sanctified with divine beauty... This very benevolence of God becomes an inconceivable curse for some parent. This is precisely what happens to a haggard woman, Chanda, who works at a rustic brick kiln to meet her daily needs. Like every dutiful mother would protect her young child, Chanda has religiously rubbed the kiln-ash every day over her daughter's ever-glowing skin for past sixteen years in order to protect her honor from the lustful eyes of this world. Chanda appears as a model of a sanctimonious motherhood and stands out as a self-respectful & strongest mother. Unfortunately due to sickness of her husband she borrows money from the brick-contractor, Shambhu, and unwillingly enrolls herself amongst those underprivileged & helpless women who undergo physical abuse in return of his monitory favor whenever he wishes so. As a hard luck would have it, one day Shambhu's eyes glimmer to see the mouth-watering attractiveness of Chanda's daughter, Chakori whose beauty was hidden under the layers of murky ash for years. Overwhelmed by this cruel situation and sensing his wicked intent, Chanda finds no other solution to safeguard her daughter's honor but to marry her to an aged 55 yrs old, Ramkhilavan who perceives his wife as nothing but a mere commodity to fulfill his sexual desires. By nature, Chakori's husband, Ramkhilavan is a pervert old man who seems overjoyed to trap a young virgin in his marital snare. To his dismay on his first night, he discovers that his young wife knows nothing about sexual act. As a wise old man he makes a prudent decision not to ravage her chastity with force but to prepare her slowly into physical submission. However in the process, the old man realizes his cardinal sin and surrenders before her sacred innocence that ultimately transforms him from a depraved demon to a holy saint.",

Eons later, civilizations founded by races of Bionis-including the humanoid Homs and the Nopon-came under attack from the Mechon, a horde of machines from Mechonis. The Homs fought to defend their existence, which would be settled at the Battle of Sword Valley. Armed with the Monado, a legendary blade that can penetrate Mechon armor, the Homs' hero Dunban fought against the Mechon threat. Those fighting alongside Dunban included Dickson, a seasoned traveler and old friend of Dunban, and Mumkhar, an honorless soldier who secretly wants the Monado for himself. During the battle, Dunban was almost overcome by the Monado's power and fell. While Dickson tried to help him, Mumkhar saw his own chance to escape. While running, he fell down a slope and came face to face with a horde of armed Mechon. Dunban and Dickson, however, recovered quickly, and led a final charge against the approaching Mechon, completely destroying their army and winning the battle. However, wielding the Monado caused great harm to Dunban's body, negating the use of his right arm. Nonetheless, peace was temporarily restored to the colonies.",

If an egg is fertilized it will remain within that thickened lining for nourishment. But if the egg is not fertilized, the body has no use for the extra nourishment, and it passes out of the body - which is the process called menstruation. The narrator proceeds to disprove taboos against bathing or exercise during menstruation. She advises that girls should keep a calendar that keeps track of the number days between periods.

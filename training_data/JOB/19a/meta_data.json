                "Grace is chairing her 20th class reunion committee, with Marjorie being her chief volunteer \"slave\". The reunion is a time for her class to reflect on their lives. Marjorie is happy with her life with Ollie, but is concerned about continually not being able to make ends meet. She also wants to start a family, which Ollie does not want to do until they are financially solvent. Ollie, on the other hand, is unhappy with the path he chose for his professional life, stating that if he had to do it all over again he would choose to be a pilot. This unhappiness spills over into his personal life which in turn concerns and affects Marjorie. As Grace complains that no one in New Bedford from their class has made anything important of their lives that would be inspirational enough to be the keynote address for the reunion, Fred Wales, an old classmate and renowned pilot, makes an emergency landing in New Bedford with his business partner, Warner Shank. Fred's arrival stirs up the 'what I should have done with my life' amongst his old classmates, especially Ollie, who is quietly envious of Fred. His arrival also stirs up ideas amongst the younger generation of what they can do with their lives, especially Fat and Maisey who both want to be pilots when they grow up. Fred is the obvious choice for the reunion's keynote address. Warner is an opportunistic businessman who will seize any opportunity to make a dollar, and on this trip he is using Fred as his glitzy front man - this glitz which hides a poor business plan - to start a new airline serving Northern Ontario. The glitz does not work on May, who Warner wants as a major investor; May sees that Warner is on to a good idea, but that he is not the one to execute it and she decides not to invest. So Warner moves onto the next person from who he can make some money, namely Ollie. He encourages Ollie to build a plane that he has designed, promising him wealth and fame if he does. Ollie, excited that he may be able to break out of his rut, works on his plane with fervor with help from Fat and Maisey, but on its showing to the press, the plane malfunctions badly. Ollie is humiliated, that is until Warner encourages him some more, telling him to make a few modifications to the design which they can ultimately patent. Fred, whose worldly and famous fa\u00e7ade masks some deep seated loneliness and unhappiness of its own, wakes Ollie up to the fact that Warner is just using him. Marjorie, seeing how destructive this series of events has had on her husband, seeks help from the only person who can get Ollie out of his funk, that person being Grace.",

He's wanted to date her ever since she moved to New York, but she's always been in a relationship. Even between relationships, it's been a matter of hours before she was with another man in a long term relationship. So when Ted finds out, with the help of Maggie's cooperative neighbor, that Maggie is once again single, Ted rushes over to her apartment before another man swoops in. He gets there in time. As Ted forgot that he has a class to teach for the time that he and Maggie are supposed to go on their first date, he asks Marshall and Lily to keep her away from any men until he returns. That plan goes slightly awry when Marshall, reading through an old letter he found that he wrote to his 30 year old self when he was 15, hits a sudden and early mid-life crisis, to which he and by association Lily have to attend. They leave Maggie in Robin's care. When Robin has to attend to another crisis in helping Ted, she leaves Maggie with Ted's worst nightmare: Barney. Will Barney respect Ted more than Maggie's babiliciousness? Meanwhile, the discussion in Ted's class that evening is a little different than in a standard architecture class.",

Chuckles the Clown died today from - from uh - he died a broken man. Chuckles, uh, leaves a wife. At least I assume he was married, he didn't seem like the other kind. I don't know his age, but I guess he was probably in his early sixties; it's kind of hard to judge a guy's face especially when he's wearing big lips and a light bulb for a nose. But he had his whole life in front of him, except for the sixty some odd years he already lived. I remember, Chuckles used to recite a poem at the end of each program. It was called \"The Credo of the Clown,\" and I'd like to offer it now in his memory - \"A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants.\" That's what it's all about, folks, that's what he stood for, that's what gave his life meaning.
